Create a JavaScript program that will show the average grade for each student.
Here are the points for each student:

Martin = 76

Thomas = 85

Klaus = 65

Maria = 93

David = 81

Based on their points, output the grade, according to the following table:

< 60 F

< 70 D

< 80 C

< 90 B

< 100 A

Finally, calculate the class average and output it (e.g. if the class average is 74 points, their average grade will be C).
